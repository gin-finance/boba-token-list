# Boba Community Token List

This NPM module and GitHub repo contains the Boba community token list used in the GIN FINANCE interface.  

__Note__: you can still create pairs, swap, add liquidity (and everything else) with your project token without doing any of the following.  
This section is just to add logo to your token and add your token to the __boba token list__ so that it will show up in the token selection dropdown. (and other people can use __boba token list__ as well to include your token in their projects)


## Disclaimer

This token repository is open sourced and managed by the Boba community. Anyone can submit new tokens to this repository.  

Listing tokens in this repo does NOT mean partnership with GIN FINANCE.

GIN FINANCE team does not guarantee the quality of code of the tokens added here and we do not endorese any projects directly.
